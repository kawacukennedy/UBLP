# UBLP · ZK Customs Clearance Module
> **[UBLP Ecosystem](https://github.com/ekacin/UBLP) → `modules/zk-customs`**
>
> This repository contains the Zero-Knowledge customs verification module of UBLP.
> UBLP is a multi-module protocol for end-to-end cryptographic security across logistics processes.
**Zero-Knowledge customs clearance over a mock L2 settlement layer.**
Secures customs documents using ZK proofs, BLS threshold signatures, and W3C Verifiable Credentials. Ministry ECDSA signature, carrier ZK proof, committee BLS signature — all three converge at a single L2 verification point.

## Why UBLP?
### Structural Vulnerabilities in Current Customs Systems
**Centralized approval → single point of failure.** A customs declaration passes through a single chain of authority. This binds every approval step to the judgment — and integrity — of the individual at that step. Systemic oversight is replaced by personal trust.
**No audit trail.** Who approved it, when, and on what grounds? Rejection reasons are not required to be recorded. The audit log lives on paper or in closed systems — independent third parties cannot verify it. Accountability after the fact is structurally difficult.
**No document integrity guarantee.** There is no independent layer verifying that the document in circulation after ministry approval is identical to the one that was signed. If content is altered post-approval, the current system has no mechanism to detect it.
**Multiple actors, zero coordination guarantee.** Customs broker, ministry, carrier, committee — each runs its own system. There is no shared cryptographic foundation to verify data consistency between them.
**Trust is built on intent, not math.** Current systems rely on the good faith of institutions and individuals. UBLP's proposition: move trust to cryptographic verification and immutable records. Low-risk, compliant shipments clear automatically — human oversight focuses on genuinely high-risk cases.
### UBLP's Approach
| Problem | UBLP Solution |
|---------|---------------|
| Single authority = single corruption point | BLS t-of-n: approval requires 2/3 committee signatures |
| "Was the document signed?" cannot be verified | ZK circuit: SHA256(document) ↔ ministry sig — mathematical binding |
| Forged documents go undetected | `document_hash` immutable on L2 — any post-approval change breaks ZK verification |
| Holder identity exposed | Holder privacy: holder sig is ZK private input, L2 only sees `holderPubKeyHash` |
| Compromised key endangers past records | Timestamped revocation: only `settledAt >= compromisedAt` flagged SUSPICIOUS |
| Who approved is unclear | `groupKeyHash` + `signerIds` → which committee members signed is on record |
UBLP makes data manipulation structurally impossible in the post-approval phase — during transport, committee signing, and border crossing. The ministry's initial approval still relies on human judgment; UBLP does not replace that decision, it cryptographically secures everything that follows. A single committee member's signature is insufficient; any document change after ministry approval breaks ZK verification.

## Architecture
### Role Definitions
| Service | Real-World Counterpart | Role |
|---------|------------------------|------|
| `customs-broker` | Customs broker | Prepares document, forwards to carrier — demo client |
| `ministry` | Customs Ministry | Reviews document, signs with ECDSA, issues VC |
| `ublp-agent` | Carrier / freight forwarder | Receives VC, generates ZK proof, obtains committee attestation, submits to L2 |
| `committee` | Accredited committee (e.g. exporters' union) | Verifies ZK proof, applies BLS threshold signature |
| `l2-verifier-mock` | L2 chain | Verifies BLS + ZK, settles document |
### Flow

## Quick Start
### Requirements
- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekacin/UBLP.git
cd UBLP/modules/zk-customs
npm install
npm run dev
```
npm run dev does the following:

Compiles all workspaces (tsc)
Committee (:3004) → Ministry (:3001) → Agent (:3002) → L2 (:3003)
Runs the customs broker demo: prepares document, receives VC from ministry, forwards to agent, logs L2 result
Ports:

3001 — Ministry
3002 — UBLP Agent / Carrier
3003 — L2 Verifier
3004 — Committee
customs-broker does not open a port — it is a one-shot demo script. In production, this role is handled by the customs broker's own system.

Environment Variables
All services run with zero config in development mode. For production:

Ministry (ministry/.env)
# Private key encryption — if unset, stored as plaintext (development only!)
MINISTRY_KEY_PASSPHRASE=strong-passphrase-here

# Optional
MINISTRY_DID=did:ublp:ministry
COMMITTEE_URL=http://localhost:3004
Committee (committee/.env)
# BLS private key encryption — if unset, stored as plaintext (development only!)
COMMITTEE_KEY_PASSPHRASE=strong-passphrase-here

# Optional
COMMITTEE_PORT=3004
UBLP Agent (ublp-agent/.env)
# Optional
AGENT_DID=did:ublp:agent:default
L2_VERIFIER_URL=http://localhost:3003
COMMITTEE_URL=http://localhost:3004
L2 Verifier (l2-verifier-mock/.env)
# dev (default): accepts mock-ecdsa-p256
# sp1: accepts only sp1-groth16 / sp1-plonk
PROOF_MODE=dev

# Optional
MINISTRY_URL=http://localhost:3001
COMMITTEE_URL=http://localhost:3004
Customs Broker (customs-broker/.env)
# Optional — defaults work for development
MINISTRY_URL=http://localhost:3001
UBLP_AGENT_URL=http://localhost:3002

# Carrier DID embedded in document — must match agent's AGENT_DID
AGENT_DID=did:ublp:agent:default
SP1 (For real ZK proving — optional)
# Succinct Prover Network
SP1_PROVER_NETWORK_KEY=<succinct-api-key>
SP1_PROVER_URL=https://rpc.succinct.xyz

# ELF generated after "cargo prove build" in sp1-circuit/
SP1_ELF_PATH=sp1-circuit/elf/ublp-verifier
If SP1 env is not set, the system automatically falls back to mock mode.

API Reference
Ministry — POST /api/approve
{
  "documentId": "DOC-uuid",
  "holderDid": "did:ublp:agent:default",
  "exporterName": "ACME Logistics Ltd.",
  "..."
}
Returns: UBLPVerifiableCredential

UBLP Agent — POST /api/process
{
  "verifiableCredential": { "..." }
}
Returns: { presentation: UBLPVerifiablePresentation, l2Result: L2SettleResponse }

L2 Verifier — GET /api/records
Returns: L2SettleRecord[]

L2 Verifier — POST /api/revoke-key
{
  "ministryPublicKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----...",
  "compromisedAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z"
}
compromisedAt is optional. If omitted, the key is rejected from this point forward; past records are unaffected.

L2 Verifier — POST /api/sync
Refreshes ministry and committee data (use if a service restarts).

ZK Circuit (SP1)
sp1-circuit/src/main.rs
Private inputs (not exposed to L2):

ministry_signature — P-256 ECDSA, 64 byte IEEE P1363
ministry_pub_key_raw — uncompressed SEC1, 65 byte
document_hash — SHA256("ublp-doc-v1:" + canonicalJson), 32 byte
document_id_hash — 32 byte
holder_signature — P-256 ECDSA, 64 byte — holder privacy
holder_pub_key_raw — uncompressed SEC1, 65 byte
holder_did — UTF-8 bytes
Public outputs (verified by L2):

document_hash — document fingerprint
ministry_pub_key_hash — SHA256(ministry raw key)
document_id_hash — replay protection
holder_pub_key_hash — holder identity proof; hash only, not raw key
Circuit build (requires Rust + SP1 toolchain):

cd sp1-circuit
cargo prove build
Security Model
Risk	Protection
Ministry monopoly	BLS t-of-n committee; 2/3 threshold
Holder identity leak	Holder sig is ZK private input; L2 only sees holderPubKeyHash
Document content leak	rawDocument excluded from VP; document content consumed inside circuit
Replay attack	documentIdHash unique constraint on L2
Key compromise	Timestamped revocation; only settledAt >= compromisedAt flagged SUSPICIOUS
Proof downgrade	PROOF_MODE set server-side via L2 env; not client-controlled
Key at rest	Ministry + Committee: AES-256-GCM + PBKDF2
